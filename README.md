## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. You may need to add API keys or other configuration if you're extending the Genkit functionality, for example, a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for the Google AI provider.
    ```env
    # Example .env file content
    # GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the development server for Next.js (frontend):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    This will typically start the app on `http://localhost:9002`.

5.  **(Optional) Run the Genkit development server (for AI flows):**
    If you are actively developing or debugging Genkit flows, you might want to run the Genkit watcher:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    # or
    # yarn genkit:watch
    ```
    This usually starts the Genkit developer UI on `http://localhost:4000`.

Now you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` to see the application in action!
